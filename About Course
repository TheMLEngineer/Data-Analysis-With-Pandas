Instructor :

Boris Paskhaver
Software Engineer

Hi there! I'm a New York City-based software engineer with experience building apps with React / Redux, Angular, and Ruby on Rails!

Like many of my peers, I did not follow a conventional approach to my current role as a web developer. After graduating from New York University in 2013 with a degree in Business Economics and Marketing, I worked as a business analyst, systems administrator, and data analyst for a variety of companies including a digital marketing agency, a financial services firm, and an international tech powerhouse. At one of those roles, I was fortunate enough to be challenged to build several projects with Python and JavaScript. 

There was no formal computer science education for me; I discovered coding entirely by accident! A small work interest quickly blossomed into a passionate weekend hobby. In early 2017, I left my former role to attend App Academy, a rigorous full-stack web development bootcamp in NYC. The rest is history!

I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and education, especially since I've struggled with many of the traditional resources people use to learn how to program. My goal as an instructor is to create comprehensive step-by-step courses that break down the complex details into small, digestible pieces. I like to build the kind of material that I myself would have loved to have when I was starting out.

I'm passionate about teaching and would love to help you discover what code can do for you. I hope to see you in a course soon!
